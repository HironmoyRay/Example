        <h1>Difference between Local Storage and Session Storage </h1>
        <p> <strong>Local Storage:</strong> This read-only interface property provides access to the Document’s local
            storage object, the
            stored data is stored across browser sessions. Similar to sessionStorage, except that localStorage data gets
            cleared when the page session ends – that is when the page is closed. It is cleared when the last “private”
            tab
            of a browser is closed (localStorage data for a document loaded in a private browsing or incognito session).

            DOMStrings are storage formats that use UTF-16 to encode data, which uses two bytes per character. Strings
            are
            automatically generated from integer keys just as they are for objects. The data stored in LocalStorage is
            specific to a protocol in the document. If the site is loaded over HTTP (e.g., http://example.com),
            localStorage
            returns a different object than if it is loaded over HTTPS (e.g., https://abc.com).

            If a document is loaded from a file: URL (that is, directly from the user’s local file system instead of
            being
            loaded from the server) the requirements for behavior are undefined and may vary among different browsers.
            Each
            file appears to be returned a different object by localStorage in all current browsers: URL. Essentially, it
            seems to be a case of each URL: file having its own unique local storage area.


            This behavior cannot be guaranteed because as mentioned above, the file: URL requirements remain unclear. As
            such, there’s a possibility that browsers may change how they handle files at any time. The way some
            browsers
            handle it has evolved.

            Local storage has 4 methods:</br></br>

            <strong>setItem() Method</strong> – This method takes two parameters one is key and another one is value. It
            is used to store
            the value in a particular location with the name of the key.</br>
            localStorage.setItem(key, value)</br></br>
            <strong>getItem() Method</strong> – This method takes one parameter that is key which is used to get the
            value stored with a
            particular key name.</br>
            localStorage.getItem(key)</br></br>
            <strong>removeItem() Method</strong> – This is method is used to remove the value stored in the memory in
            reference to
            key.</br>
            localStorage.removeItem(key)</br></br>
            <strong>clear() Method</strong> – This method is used to clear all the values stored in localstorage.</br>
            localStorage.clear()
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong> Session Storage:</strong> Session Storage objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage
            read-only property. The difference between
            sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is
            cleared when the page session ends. A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded in a
            browser tab. Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a time. Pages are only saved for the amount of time
            that the tab or the browser is open; they do not persist after the page reloads and restores. A new session
            is created each time a tab or window is opened; this is different from session cookies. Each tab/window that
            is opened with the same URL creates its own sessionStorage.When you duplicate a tab, the sessionStorage from
            the original tab is copied to the duplicated tab. Closing a window/tab ends the session and clears
            sessionStorage objects.

            A page’s protocol determines what data is stored in sessionStorage. Particularly, data stored by scripts
            accessed through HTTP (for example, http://abc.com) is stored in a separate object from the same site
            accessed through HTTPS (for instance, https://abc.com). A DOMString number is two bytes per character in
            UTF-16 DOMString format. Strings are automatically generated from integer keys just as they are for objects.

            Session Storage has 4 methods: <br><br>

            <strong>setItem() Method </strong> – This method takes two parameters one is key and another one is value.
            It is used to store
            the value in a particular location with the name of the key.<br>
            sessionStorage.setItem(key, value)<br><br>
            <strong>getIteam() Method</strong> – This method takes one parameter that is key which is used to get the
            value stored with a
            particular key name.<br>
            sessionStorage.getItem(key)<br><br>

        <h1>Difference between global scope and block scope?</h1>

        <p>
            <strong>Function Scope </strong> : When a variable is declared inside a function, it is only accessible
            within that function and cannot be used outside that function. <br>

            <strong>Block Scope </strong> : A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or
            while loops, are accessible within that particular condition or loop.
        </p>

        <h1> How does javascript event loop work ?</h1>
        <p>The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is
            empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which
            effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>

            The global undefined property represents the primitive value undefined. It is one of JavaScript's primitive
            types. <br> <br>

            Property attributes of undefined: <br>
            <strong>Writable </strong> - no. <br>
            <strong>Enumerable </strong> - no. <br>
            <strong>Configurable </strong> - no. <br>
